System Scope and Context
========================

The work presented in this document proposed a Proof-of-Concept of an
:abbr:`MDD (Model Driven Development)` Approach. The approach is focused on
showing a possible workflow to develop AGL applications and services.
:numref:`r_context_mdd` shows the context diagram of such an approach. Note that
the proposed solution should consider *AGL* components in order to provide
a smooth integration with the AGL Linux Distribution.
